Tidy Data and Script:

 I created a  runanalysis.r script which performs the following

Merged the train  and test datasets .
Labelled with descriptive activity names.
Extracted only the mean and std for each measurement as asked.
used dplyr ,tidyr, and stringr  packages to tidy the dataset for labelling with descriptive variable names
created  an independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


 CodeBook :
         describes  the variables used and transformations made to create a tidy database.
